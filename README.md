![Light Field Imaging Toolkit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFDL/LFIT/master/header.png)

This toolkit exists to facilitate quick processing of images captured using a plenoptic camera. Original developers are Jeffrey Bolan and Kyle Johnson.  Current primary developer is Elise Munz. Many thanks to Dr. Brian Thurow, Tim Fahringer, Paul Anglin, Dominic Hildebrandt, and Chelsea Thomason for extensive discussions and contributions that made this toolkit possible. This toolkit was developed in MATLAB R2013b for use in Microsoft Windows. Hexagonal support is limited to MATLAB R2013a or newer, while rectangular camera array compatibility includes R2009a and newer. Macintosh compatibility is officially unsupported (although it may be useable with some modifications). Possible issues may arise on MATLAB 2014b and newer. Contact Brian Thurow (thurow@auburn.edu) with any questions, comments, or concerns regarding the MATLAB version of this toolkit.
